# Assignment 2

### Gibbs Sampling

Use Gibbs sampling algortithm to calculate the probability distribution

### Kalman Filter

Use Kalman filter to predict the GDP.

The programming language adopts Matlab. The script can be running in recent Matlab (over Matlab 2012).

1. Input: 2 or 3 for 2 files. (Representing the 2-sensor model and the 3-sensor model)
2. kalman_whole.m is the full version of the Kalman filter implementation.
3. kalman_transition_only.m is the version for Transition model
